                <h2>Vijay Kumar</h2>
                <p>  Since a young age, I have been passionate about helping people in need. During college, I decided to focus my studies on sociology and political science. I used my knowledge to take action and participated in several non-profit organizations to promote social justice. With the help of internships, I have also gained experience in policy development and public relations. Iâ€™m currently working on a graduate degree in Social Work and aim to eventually work for the United Nations.</p>
