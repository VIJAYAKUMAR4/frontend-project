                     <P>My message, especially to young people
                        is to have courage to think differently,
                        courage to invent, to travel the
                        unexplored path, courage to discover
                        the impossible and to conquer the
                        problems and succeed. These are great
                        qualities that they must work towards.
                        This is my message to the young people.</P>
