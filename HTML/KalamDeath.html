  <p> On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a 
    Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. 
    While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was 
    able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.At around 6:35 p.m. IST, 
    only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[87][88] He was rushed to the 
    nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse
    or any other signs of life.[87] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit,
    Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.His last 
    words,to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing 
    well?</p>
