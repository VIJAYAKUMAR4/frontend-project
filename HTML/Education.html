    <p> In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright 
        and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his 
        studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his education at the
        Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend
        Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University 
        of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras 
        in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
        While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied
        with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the
        project was finished within the next three days. </p>
